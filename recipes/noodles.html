    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These egg noodles are the old-fashioned type, just like 
        Grammy used to make! Try them next time you prepare your 
        favorite soup or stew. Don't forget that fresh pasta cooks
         much quicker than dried! You may use a dough hook 
         attachment on your electric mixer or your hands to knead 
         the pasta dough.</p>
